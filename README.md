# JohnArmon Antolin's Web Portfolio

## Project Description 
This HTML, CSS and JS program acts as a portfolio website.

HTML5, CSS3 and vanilla JavaScript were used for this project to learn its basic syntax and semantics throug the operations of static pages of a portfolio website.

A challenge that came about was how to initially connect the styling and JavaScript scripts to the HTML pages so that the pages have styling and functionality. Having learned how to connect the external CSS file with a link in an HTML head section and and a src in a script tag will be helpful for future uses where HTML pages need an external CSS file and JS file.

## Installation
This website is currently hosted by Github pages and can be found here: https://jarmonteach.github.io/WebPortfolio/

## Usage

  1. The landing page will have an introduction section, description of services, short bio, examples of work/projects and a footer that can be navigated to.
  2. A resume button is available in the short bio section and will download a pdf of my resume when clicked.
  3. In the my work section, each image can be clicked to go to other pages that will describe the respective project.
  4. On each of those individual project pages, the client, task, challenge, solution elements, tools and link to the code repository are available to be read or accessed. 
  5. For certain project that have private repositories due to the project's client, there will be demos of that project instead of access to a code repository.
