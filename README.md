# JohnArmon Antolin's Web Portfolio

## Project Description 
This HTML, CSS and JS program acts as a portfolio website.

HTML5, CSS3 and vanilla JavaScript were used for this project to learn its basic syntax and semantics throug the operations of static pages of a portfolio website.

A challenge that came about was how to initially connect the styling and JavaScript scripts to the HTML pages so that the pages have styling and functionality. Having learned how to connect the external CSS file with a link in an HTML head section and and a src in a script tag will be helpful for future uses where HTML pages need an external CSS file and JS file.
