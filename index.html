                    <h3 class="service-subtitle">Web Design</h3>
                    <p>The creative process of designing a website or application is a key aspect to why I have enjoyed programming. It is essential to not only have websites that have relative and accurate information, but that information should be presented in a way that is easy for the user to navigate through because of its simplicity and clean design. Design should be responsive and a major tool to the brand or promotion of that person(s) or business. Examples of my design is this website portfolio and the wedding website found in the My Work section below.</p>

                    <h3 class="service-subtitle">Software/App Development</h3>
                    <p>The aim of software development is simple: create technological solutions that benefits lives. That beneficial solution can occur in various ways because every client <span>&#8212;</span> whether a person or business <span>&#8212;</span> is different. It is important throughout development to keep a client centric approach that is simple, transparent and unique to meet that client's requirements and expectations. Careful planning along with innovative and curious minds will lead to an efficient and practical project solution. Two dashboard software project examples that I was a part of can be found in the My Work section below.</p>

                    <h3 class="service-subtitle">Educator</h3>
                    <p>Education, knowledge and understanding are the basis of accomplishing any task in life. Trainers, educators and teachers simplify the complex and make abstract concepts and make them accessible to students and people. One of my greatest experiences is teaching two computer courses to six different classes at a high school in Jacksonville, FL. It is fulfilling to see other people starting to understand complex programming concepts and to see in myself how I have grown in understanding of those concepts. More details of my experience in being an educator can be found in my resume which can be downloaded below.</p>
