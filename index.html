                    <p>Data is valuable. Finding this value is done through collecting, organizing and analyzing data. Collection through web scrapping or using APIs, organization by cleaning data and analyzing data especially through vizualization can help solve business problems in predicting specific outcomes and/or creating new categories on the natural structure of that data. In a world that continues to grow in the data being created, processed and used, the repository of valuable data is just waiting to be discovered. A couple data science projects that portray these principles can be found in the My Work section below.</p>

                    <h3 class="service-subtitle">Software/App Development</h3>
                    <p>The aim of software development is simple: create technological solutions that benefits lives. That beneficial solution can occur in various ways because every client <span>&#8212;</span> whether a person or business <span>&#8212;</span> is different. It is important throughout development to keep a client centric approach that is simple, transparent and unique to meet that client's requirements and expectations. Careful planning along with innovative and curious minds will lead to an efficient and practical project solution. A major dashboard software project that builds on these principles can be found in the My Work section below.</p>

                    <h3 class="service-subtitle">Educator</h3>
                    <p>Education, knowledge and understanding are the basis of accomplishing any task in life. Trainers, educators and teachers simplify the complex and make abstract concepts and make them accessible to students and people. One of my greatest experiences is teaching two computer courses to six different classes at a high school in Jacksonville, FL. It is fulfilling to see other people starting to understand complex programming concepts and to see in myself how I have grown in understanding of those concepts. More details of my experience in being an educator can be found in my resume which can be downloaded below.</p>
