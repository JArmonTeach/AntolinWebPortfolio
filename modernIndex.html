            <h2 class="about-heading">About Me</h2>
            <h3>Software/Web Developer based out of FL</h3>

            <p>I graduated from the University of North Florida with a bachelor's degree in Computing and Information Sciences.</p>

            <p>I have had professional experience teaching in a high school, performing clerical work in a few church offices, being a chaplain in various medical facilities throughout Florida and being a consumer assistant at a retail center.</p>

            <p>Some of my responsibilities were — but were not restricted to — data entry, project production, and educator which developed my verbal and written communication, problem-solving skills, teamwork attitude, patience, time management and creativity.</p>

                <h3>Software/App Development</h3>

                <p>The aim of software development is simple: create technological solutions that benefit lives. How we implement that solution is the challenging part. This challenge is what I love facing with every programming project I have done and each one has taught me something new. In the software development life cycle, I value careful planning, collaboration, persistence and patience.</p>

                <h3>Data Analysis/Science</h3>

                <p>Data is valuable, but it is not always informative. I enjoy going through the process of collecting, organizing and analyzing data because even though it can be tedious, there is a sense of excitement in the discovery. Through that data analysis and visualization, I can turn data into information, and information into insight.</p>

                <h3>Educator</h3>

                <p>Teaching is inspiring change in people. My passion for teaching has helped me grow, not only in expressing concepts in clearer ways to diverse thinkers, but to be a better learner of new ideas as well. Personally, it is  fulfilling to see students stop merely absorbing facts and information and instead, start acquiring understanding; it's like seeing a light turn on in their heads.</p>
